# Auto-ML H2O for IRIS Prediction

This project demonstrates how to use H2O's AutoML to predict the IRIS ratio, specifically focusing on the potential of insolvency. It's designed to run on Google Colab, utilizing its powerful cloud computing capabilities.

## Getting Started
### 1.Colab/Jupyter Notebook
#### Google Colab

Downoad the main.ipynb and move it into your google drive, and place the CSV file that needs to be analyzed into the specified directory, and according to the instructions in the document, you can start the analysis. Users can also adjust their own analysis entries, and specific information can be obtained from the document.

#### Jupyter Notebook

Before installing Jupyter Notebook, ensure you have the following: 

- Python 3 installed on your system (Python 2 is also supported but Python 3 is recommended). 

- PIP (Python package manager) installed.

Open your terminal (Command Prompt or PowerShell for Windows, Terminal app for macOS and Linux/Unix) and run the following command:    ```bash   pip install notebook ```

1. **Verify Installation**

   After installation, you can verify that Jupyter has been installed by running:

   ```
   bashCopy code
   jupyter notebook --version
   ```

2. **Launch Jupyter Notebook**

   To start Jupyter Notebook, run:

   ```
   bashCopy code
   jupyter notebook
   ```

   This will start the Jupyter Notebook server and open the application in your default web browser.

### Run by Python directly

## Prerequisites 

The project is intended to be run on Google jupyter notebook, you can also use it on google colab, which provides most of the necessary packages and environments. However, if you're setting up a similar environment locally or elsewhere, you'll need:

- Python 3.x
- H2O
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Scikit-learn
- JRE (Java Runtime Environment) for H2O
